                <h3>Why UMD?</h3>
                <p> I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth for its location and programs offered. I wanted to stay in state for college and I liked the Duluth area. I wasn't sure of my major when coming into college but I had a couple interests. I chose UMD beacuse it had several majors that I was interested in.</p>

                <h3>The Duluth Area</h3>
                <p>I like the Duluth area becasue I get the chance to live in a bigger city but there is still plenty of nature areas. Duluth has the feel of a bigger town with some of the amenities that you would find in a smaller town.</p>
