                    <h2>CD Collecting</h2>
                    <p> I love collecting CDs and some vinyls. My collection started after getting Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park from my dad. It was the one CD that he had in his truck and I played it on repeat when I borrowed his truck. Getting my first CD jumpstarted my love for music and my CD collecting hobby. I have slowley collected about 60 CDs since then and I love finding a new alblum to add to my collection. </p>

                    <h2>Art</h2>
                    <p> I always loved painting and drawing when I was younger, and over time it progressed into a hobby I've spent a lot of time and money on. I really started drawing seriously in 6th grade, and my teacher helped me cultivate my love for art. She started desigate times during the week for her students to explore hobbies and interests. Having time focus on my art during the school day was big for me, and having a teacher that encouraged her students helped push me to continue drawing even if I wasn't very good.</p>
